## How to Use WinAlign 9.2 2009
 
To use WinAlign 9.2 2009, you need to open the WinAlign application by double-clicking on its icon on your desktop or in your Start menu. You will see the main interface of WinAlign, which consists of a menu bar, a toolbar, a status bar, and a task pane.
 
The task pane is where you can create and manage your alignment tasks. To create a new task, you can click on the "Add a New Task" button on the toolbar or select "Tasks > Add New Task" from the menu bar. You will then see a dialog box where you can enter the name of your task, choose the source and target languages, and select the source and target files or folders that you want to align.
 
WinAlign 9.2 2009 supports various file formats for alignment, such as Word (.doc), HTML (.htm), XML (.xml), Tagged Text (.ttx), Rich Text Format (.rtf), Plain Text (.txt), and Unicode Text (.utx). You can also align files that have been converted by S-Tagger from QuarkXPress (.qxd) or InDesign (.indd) formats.
 
After you have selected your files or folders for alignment, you can click on the "OK" button to start the alignment process. WinAlign will scan your files or folders and display them in a tree view in the task pane. You can then expand or collapse the nodes of the tree view to see the individual files or subfolders that have been aligned.
 
To view and edit the alignment results, you can double-click on any file node in the task pane or select "Tasks > Open Selected File" from the menu bar. You will then see a split window where you can see the source text on the left side and the target text on the right side. You can also see the alignment status of each segment (sentence or paragraph) by looking at its color code: green for aligned segments, yellow for partially aligned segments, red for unaligned segments, and blue for locked segments.
 
You can modify the alignment results by using various commands from the menu bar or toolbar, such as "Edit > Align", "Edit > Split", "Edit > Merge", "Edit > Delete", "Edit > Lock", "Edit > Unlock", etc. You can also use keyboard shortcuts or drag-and-drop operations to perform these commands.
 
When you are satisfied with your alignment results, you can save them as translation memories (.tmw), glossaries (.glo), or
